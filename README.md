# Research Project Faculty Selection and Mailing Automation

This project contains an automation software designed to streamline the process of selecting and mailing faculty members based on their respective time zones for the application of a research project. The application primarily utilizes various Python libraries, including `smtplib`, `pandas`, and `email`, among others, for seamless automation.

## Key Features

- **Time Zone-based Faculty Selection:** Automatically selects faculty members based on their specific time zones, ensuring timely communication and collaboration for the research project.

- **Smtplib Integration:** Seamlessly integrates the `smtplib` library to facilitate the process of sending emails directly from the application.

- **Pandas for Data Handling:** Utilizes the `pandas` library to efficiently read and manage data stored in the `profData.csv` file, which contains essential information about the professors involved in the research project.

- **MIME and Email Formatting:** Incorporates the `MIME` and `Email` libraries to ensure that emails are professionally formatted and presented to the faculty members.

- **Time Zone Triggers:** Utilizes the `time` library to set specific time zone triggers, enabling precise scheduling and coordination for effective communication with faculty members.
